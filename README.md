  Basic concepts using Redux
</h3>

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
Following a YT **[Redux Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwheJHvseC3I0HuYI2f46oAK)** went through some of the basics to start on Redux without any UI.

Included a pdf with my notes from the classes: **[justsomeRedux](https://github.com/AndrasE/Redux-tutorial/blob/main/justsomeRedux.pdf)**.

**Subjects**: Basic principles, Actions, Action-creators, Reducers, Multiple Reducers, Combining Reducers, Middleware, Async actions, Async action creators

This repo served as a fundation for the **[React-Redux Tutorial](https://github.com/AndrasE/Redux-tutorial)**.
